# HIIT workout personal audio trainer

This script scrapes youtube and creates your own mp3 that you can take offline with you to the gym. A personal trainer and DJ will guide you through a HIIT workout and keep you entertained all the while.

You want to get fit??!!!! Boy, you came to the right software!

This was developed and tested in python 3.7 on Windows. It might work with older versions of python. So far, I've tested this once in the gym which helped me to adjust the workout. I will continue to update the code as I have more revelations in the gym.

## Getting started:

You need python (I used 3.7)

You need ffmpeg, and your environment variables point to it. Instructions:
